/// @note	To derive a new such object, one would have to inherit from
///			OFSmartObject, as well as declare and implement the RTTI system 
///			either by hand or using the predefined macros OFDeclareRTTI and 
///			OFImplementRTTI. 
///
/// @note	To avoid the requirement of calling AddRef/Release

/// @note	RTTI implementation is optional but recommended.

/// @note	Use the onSharedPtr type for non-intrusive shared pointers.

/// @remarks	Prefer the onIntrusivePtr datatype for declarations of
